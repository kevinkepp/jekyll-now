I'm passionate about applying machine learning algorithms to meaningful real-world problems.
I've studied Computer Science at [Technical University Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de) with focus on theory and applications of machine intelligence.
In my Master's thesis at [Fraunhofer HHI](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/) I explored how to train neural networks more efficiently using gradient compression during backpropagation.
