I'm passionate about applying Machine Intelligence to meaningful real-world problems.
I've studied Computer Science at [Technical University Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de) with focus on machine learning theory and applications.
In my Master's thesis at the [machine learning group](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/vca/research-groups/machine-learning.html) of [Fraunhofer HHI](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/) I explored how to train neural networks more efficiently using gradient compression during backpropagation.
