I'm studying Computer Science at [Technical University Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de) with focus on machine learning theory and applications.
I currently work at the [machine learning group](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/vca/research-groups/machine-learning.html) of [Fraunhofer HHI](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/) on my Master's thesis about efficient neural networks.
