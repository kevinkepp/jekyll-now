title: Probabilistic and Bayesian Modelling
sitemap: false
---

The lecture presents an advanced study of probabilistic models which are widely used in Machine Learning and AI. These models can deal with uncertainties and prior knowledge in a principled way and can be adapted to a given problem by learning from training examples. 
We will discuss the basic ideas and the computational techniques using a variety of applications.
